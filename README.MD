## Note

Hi guys! School year was started, and I understood that I have literally up to 30 minutes for coding a day. At school for some reasons it's not acceptable to use laptops during the lessons (new Italian law), so I have to reduce amount of projects which I will publish on GitHub. I still will try to do something and continue to improve my projects, but keep in your mind that I will do it less than I was doing it before ;)
